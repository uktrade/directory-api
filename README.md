**[GREAT platform API](https://www.great.gov.uk/)**

---

## Development

### Installing

    $ git clone https://github.com/uktrade/directory-api
    $ cd directory-api
    $ virtualenv .venv -p python3.6
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ make install_requirements

### Requirements
[Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)
[Postgres 9.5](https://www.postgresql.org/)
[Redis](https://redis.io/)


#### Configuration

Secrets such as API keys and environment specific configurations are placed in `conf/env/secrets-do-not-commit` - a file that is not added to version control. To create a template secrets file with dummy values run `make init_secrets`.

### Commands

| Command                       | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ------------|
| make clean                    | Delete pyc files |
| make pytest                   | Run all tests |
| make pytest test_foo.py       | Run all tests in file called test_foo.py |
| make pytest -- --last-failed` | Run the last tests to fail |
| make pytest -- -k foo         | Run the test called foo |
| make pytest -- <foo>          | Run arbitrary pytest command |
| make flake8                   | Run linting |
| make manage <foo>             | Run arbitrary management command |
| make webserver                | Run the development web server |
| make requirements             | Compile the requirements file |
| make install_requirements     | Installed the compile requirements file |
| make css                      | Compile scss to css |
| make init_secrets             | Create your secret env var file |
| make worker                   | Run the celery worker |
| make beat                     | Run the celery beat scheduler |


## SSO
To make sso work locally add the following to your machine's `/etc/hosts`:

| IP Adress | URL                      |
| --------  | ------------------------ |
| 127.0.0.1 | buyer.trade.great    |
| 127.0.0.1 | supplier.trade.great |
| 127.0.0.1 | sso.trade.great      |
| 127.0.0.1 | api.trade.great      |
| 127.0.0.1 | profile.trade.great  |
| 127.0.0.1 | exred.trade.great    |

Then log into `directory-sso` via `sso.trade.great:8004`

Note in production, the `directory-sso` session cookie is shared with all subdomains that are on the same parent domain as `directory-sso`. However in development we cannot share cookies between subdomains using `localhost` - that would be like trying to set a cookie for `.com`, which is not supported by any RFC.

Therefore to make cookie sharing work in development we need the apps to be running on subdomains. Some stipulations:
 - `directory-ui-supplier` and `directory-sso` must both be running on sibling subdomains (with same parent domain)
 - `directory-sso` must be told to target cookies at the parent domain.
