11,"Renewable Energy NGN Case Study An intermediary reached out to inquire about our currency capabilities, specifically in frontier markets. Subsequently, we engaged in a call with their client to gain a deeper understanding of their situation.  The client had been involved in the development of multiple solar projects in Nigeria, where, due to government and banking regulations, their Nigerian customers began making payments in local currency (NGN). This resulted in the client accumulating approximately USD 1.5 million equivalent in NGN, which posed cash flow constraints as it was difficult to sell NGN due to limited liquidity in the right-hand side of the market.  However, leveraging Ebury's extensive expertise in handling exotic currencies and our strong relationships with local banks and liquidity partners, we were able to offer a solution by providing the client with dedicated NGN accounts for local collection and subsequent conversion into major currencies such as GBP, USD, or EUR.  Within a short span of 4 days, Ebury successfully onboarded the client, established their local NGN account, and initiated discussions regarding pricing. Throughout this process, we conducted thorough due diligence on the client's documentation.  Once the account was set up, Ebury provided a comprehensive quote for the total funds required to be deposited into the NGN account to cover the 1.5 million USD equivalent. The client seamlessly executed the payment, allowing Ebury to promptly convert the NGN into USD on behalf of the client, thereby resolving their cash flow challenges.",TRUE

Its main business is to transport goods between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. It collects a large number of CNH, HKD, and USD every year. Last year, the GBP/CNH exchange rate once fell below 8.0, which it’s a good opportunity to sell CNH and buy GBP. The account manager at Ebury’s UK China desk immediately contacted Mr. Li, CEO of the logistics company, opened a Domiciliary CNH account in Hong Kong for Mr. Li’s company and locked the exchange rate at 7.9. At present, the pound has risen above 9.1. Tailored hedging strategies to maximise profitability Some logistics companies and companies that rely on international logistics for trade usually face higher exchange rate risks. Mr. Li's company mainly undertakes the transportation of goods in Hong Kong and Mainland China, so it often receives a significant amount of local payments in CNH, HKD or USD. Since the company is located in the UK, the funds need to be converted into GBPBritish pounds to operate.  Mr. Li said: ""Ebury's service is very professional and attentive. If my relationship manager hadn't reminded us in time and updated us with the latest market movements, we would have missed this exchange rate price. It reduced our expenditure by us at least 400,000 yuan expenditure on foreign exchange，and increased our revenue by more than 10%."" Logistics without borders!

How he manages and uses his fund is a major concern for Mr Li.  ""We are a UK business, but we have a large number of Chinese clients who tend to pay for shipping in CNH, HKD and USD."" says Mr Li. By linking to his Ebury collection account, Mr Li has control over the use of CNH, USD and GBP and can easily track every payment arriving in the collection account in real time by simply logging into the Ebury platform. One account in hand, worry-free global collection Ebury's global payment capabilities and cross-border logistics industry can be described as excellent partners. Ebury's strong currency capabilities cover the world and can help companies open currency accounts globally instantly.
