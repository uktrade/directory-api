Subsequently, we engaged in a call with their client to gain a deeper understanding of their situation.   The client had been involved in the development of multiple solar projects in Nigeria, where, due to government and banking regulations, their Nigerian customers began making payments in local currency (NGN). This resulted in the client accumulating approximately USD 1.5 million equivalent in NGN, which posed cash flow constraints as it was difficult to sell NGN due to limited liquidity in the right-hand side of the market.   However, leveraging Ebury's extensive expertise in handling exotic currencies and our strong relationships with local banks and liquidity partners, we were able to offer a solution by providing the client with dedicated NGN accounts for local collection and subsequent conversion into major currencies such as GBP, USD, or EUR.   Within a short span of 4 days, Ebury successfully onboarded the client, established their local NGN account, and initiated discussions regarding pricing. Throughout this process, we conducted thorough due diligence on the client's documentation.   Once the account was set up, Ebury provided a comprehensive quote for the total funds required to be deposited into the NGN account to cover the 1.5 million USD equivalent. The client seamlessly executed the payment, allowing Ebury to promptly convert the NGN into USD on behalf of the client, thereby resolving their cash flow challenges.","Ebury Hong Kong currency collection capability Industry: Logistics  Country: United Kingdom,  Hongkong  Background: The client is an international logistics company located in the United Kingdom. Its main business is to transport goods between Hong Kong  and the United Kingdom. It collects a large number of CNH, HKD, and USD every year.  Last year, the GBP/CNH exchange rate once fell below 8.0, which it’s a good opportunity to sell CNH and buy GBP. The account manager at Ebury’s UK China desk immediately contacted Mr. Li, CEO of the logistics company, opened a Domiciliary CNH account in Hong Kong for Mr. Li’s company and locked the exchange rate at 7.9. At present, the pound has risen above 9.1.  Tailored hedging strategies to maximise profitability Some logistics companies and companies that rely on international logistics for trade usually face higher exchange rate risks. Mr. Li's company mainly undertakes the transportation of goods in Hong Kong and Mainland China, so it often receives a significant amount of local payments in CNH, HKD or USD. Since the company is located in the UK, the funds need to be converted into GBPBritish pounds to operate.   Mr. Li said: ""Ebury's service is very professional and attentive. If my relationship manager  hadn't reminded us in time and updated us with the latest market movements, we would have missed this exchange rate price. It reduced our expenditure by us at least 400,000 yuan expenditure on foreign exchange，and increased our revenue by more than 10%.""  Logistics without borders! Manage the global cash flows with ease The nature of a multinational business makes dealing with different currencies around the world inevitable.  How he manages and uses his fund is a major concern for Mr Li.   ""We are a UK business, but we have a large number of Chinese clients who tend to pay for shipping in CNH, HKD and USD."" says Mr Li. By linking to his Ebury collection account, Mr Li has control over the use of CNH, USD and GBP and can easily track every payment arriving in the collection account in real time by simply logging into the Ebury platform.  One account in hand, worry-free global collection  Ebury's global payment capabilities and cross-border logistics industry can be described as excellent partners. Ebury's strong currency capabilities cover the world and can help companies open currency accounts globally instantly. Mr. Li said, ""After learning about our needs, my Ebury account manager immediately helped me open accounts in Hong Kong and the UK. The process only took an hour.""  Ebury has local Chinese-speaking teams around the world. ""The team in Hong Kong and the UK really help us a lot as there is localised knowledge to understand our needs and make the most appropriate suggestions in the shortest possible time.“ Mr. Li noted.  Now Mr. Li can freely use 29 different currencies, and newly added 17 exotic currencies, mainly African currencies, a total of 40+ currencies for trade needs.",Robert.Palmer@ukexportfinance.gov.uk,Yes,Financial,"Opening bank accounts,Regulatory support",,,,,,"Agriculture, horticulture and fisheries,Business and consumer services,Education and training,Environment,Household goods, furniture and furnishings,Leisure and tourism,Legal services,Metals, minerals and materials,Oil and gas,Ports and logistics,Renewable Energy,Retail and luxury,Software and computer services,Textiles, interior textiles and carpets","England,Scotland,Wales,Northern Ireland","London,North West,North East,Midlands,South West,South East","Asia-Pacific,North America,Western Europe,North Africa,China and Hong Kong,Central Europe,West Africa,Latin America,Central Asia,Southern Africa,Eastern Europe,Middle East,Other, please specify...","Australia, Canada","English,French,Spanish,Mandarin,Cantonese,Japanese,Korean,Portuguese,Italian,German,Hindi,Arabic,Punjabi",,"0 - 10 employees,10 - 50 employees,50 + employees",,,Blank,B,0,

Now, they are keen on establishing a direct presence in the UK market through their own investments. However, they were unsure about the specific reasons behind the past difficulties. To begin with, we conducted a thorough analysis of the available data to examine the previous experience. We identified the lack of suitable location alignment with the target audience, inadequate fulfillment of competitive conditions, and improper planning of service standards as contributing factors. Based on these findings, we developed a comprehensive plan and project for addressing these challenges in the new investment, including a budget allocation and risk mitigation strategies. Within the scope of this investment project, we identified and presented alternative sales point options for the customers. Once approval is granted for the investment, we have established a structured process to be followed.

James, a senior executive for an oil and gas company was on a tight time scale having found out at late notice that he had a two year assignment in the UK, with his wife and three children. We love a challenge, so was quick to identify the family’s requirements and between us, narrowed search areas down to North London. Because they only had one day to view properties, North London gave us the opportunity to maximise our time and choices and fortunately, the family were vaguely familiar with this area.  A short commute to his office in Greenford was a huge consideration, as was closeness to an International School for the children. St Johns Wood, Swiss Cottage, Kensington and Marylebone is where we focussed an intensive home search, and due to the fast moving rental market, we also ensured that we secured an extra day’s viewings as a contingency. Fortunately, this was not needed as the Latham’s chose a perfect property in St Johns Wood that they were really happy with. After some tough negotiations with the landlord in relation to fixtures and fittings and arranging an inventory clerk to be there at check in, they are now happily settled in their new home.

Looking to explore the market, MC Global appointed JMB to launch the brand and gain a  foothold in the UK and Europe through a  comprehensive lead generation campaign. Through a highly targeted research and data  collation the objective was to create  engagement with potential clients with a view  to introducing the MC Global brand. Simultaneously to outbound activity, JMB  managed all inbound web and telephone  enquiries to provide a UK based and instil  trust and authenticity with their potential  clients. The JMB Approach. JMB held several meetings with MC to define  the proposition, identify the key objectives  and to ensure the telemarketing team were  fully equipped with knowledge of the product - enabling JMB to become an extension of the  MC Global team.Our next step was to commence a comprehensive  lead generation campaign to communicate MC’s  capabilities and gain initial sales introductions. The initial campaign consisted of a pre-arranged  meeting programme for the Managing Director of  MC to attend during a UK visit. During this trip, the  members of the JMB team attended meetings  alongside the Managing Director.  Following his departure, equipped with the  knowledge and product expertise, JMB attended  and represented the meetings of behalf of MC  Global. Acting as the UK Sales office, this flexible and  transparent approach ensured the MC brand  could continue to effectively develop meaningful  relationships and business opportunities despite being based overseas.  ","STAKA is a leading supplier of high-quality roof  access hatches and has been supplying a range  of products for over 50 years.  At the early stages of their UK growth, STAKA  required a physical presence to enhance  creditability and their accessibly to their UK  audience. This required a UK sales office.  Opening an in-market office can be costly and  time-consuming. It requires careful  consideration and investment into premise,  equipment and the recruitment of experienced staff even for established UK companies. To overcome these risks and additional  overheads, in May 2014, JMB was selected to act  as the inbound UK sales office to increase  revenue growth, act as a technical help desk and  the UK sales office for STAKA.  The JMB Approach. A full understanding of STAKA’s product range  was fundamental. In the early stages of any  project we ensure meetings are held ensure  clear goals are set out from the start. In  STAKA’s case, this was inclusive of product  training in the Netherlands.  The information agreed in these meetings  formed the basis of the Project Initiation  Document; a repository of relevant  information including company background,  their product/service & campaign objectives,  ensuring that all work is carried out in line with client expectation. The project was to ensure that incoming calls,  emails and online enquiries were dealt with.  Providing technical assistance, quotations and  subsequently processing orders in accordance with  STAKA® internal processes.  In addition, JMB also followed-up existing quotations  to ensure the status was being tracked & to enhance  sales conversion. JMB conducted this activity, whilst simultaneously  targeting the wider marketplace to increase STAKA’s  market reach and increase UK sales. The Results. Within 6 months the number of UK inbound  telephone enquires had increased tenfold. Due to the success of the model, STAKA doubled  their investment in the UK Sales office within 6  months of implementation. Today, the JMB Team is the face of STAKA UK and  manages all UK sales enquires, sales generation,  technical support and operations; and is an integral  element of STAKA’s business model and international operation.

They felt that the UK provided opportunities for the specialist building projects they were looking for.  They also identified that the UK would help them access quality talent as well as retain existing talent by giving them opportunities to work in the UK.  How your organisation engaged with the overseas business The organisation found us by searching the internet and approached us based on what they read online.  We discussed their future plans and ambitions in order to understand the best structure for their UK presence.  They were clear that they wanted a separate legal entity and that the concept of an LLP was not one they were familiar with.  We agreed that the ideal set up for them would be a limited company.    We managed the formation of the company, the Memorandum of Association and all relevant registrations.  We also facilitated the process of setting up their banking facilities.  We also guided the new company through the process of finding the talent they were after.  We were able to make introductions to specialist architecture recruitment agencies through our network.  Our HR consultancy then supported them in the creation of employment contracts and an Employee handbook.  The individual director who set up the UK company also required considerable personal tax planning and guidance on the wealth he could bring to the UK to fund the subsidiary.  We have continued to support them since they set up in the UK and provide consultancy advice on one off issues such as HR matters.  The outcome The UK subsidiary has a payroll of talent, an established database and an exciting pipeline. They continue to feel confident about the opportunities the UK market holds for them. ","Clients’ Goal Having started a life sciences business providing biomarker services in the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa, the client was keen to expand into Europe and wanted a UK base to do that. How your organisation engaged with the overseas business The opportunity came to us via our international network. We spent time understanding the client’s future ambitions for the business and talking through what would be the most appropriate structure for the UK entity.  We also liaised with the advisers in South Africa to devise the most tax efficient structure for the global organisation, particularly regarding the management charges. Having proposed the ideal structure we project managed the whole of the formation of the UK entity as well as registering it with HMRC for tax and VAT.  As the UK presence grew, we also took on the role of managing their payroll.  We have retained the UK organisation as a client ever since, producing the annual accounts as well as doing their VAT returns and running the payroll function. We also advise on their global structure such as incorporating a German company and the best legal entity there for them, a new parent company.  They have also sought our advice on VAT issues regarding where work is undertaken across the international organisation.  We also work with them on their research and development work and the relevant tax relief available.

The company wanted to establish an office in Birmingham to service a significant new UK customer.   We were asked to help choose between establishing a branch and a UK company. In this case, what was important to the client was maintaining confidentiality over financial information and avoiding the cost of an audit. A decision was made to register a branch because there is no requirement to prepare and disclose accounting documents under the parent law, so no requirement to deliver accounts to Companies House. Tax savings or deferral of tax might have been achieved by registering a UK company, but that was not regarded as important.   By making use of the Companies House same-day service, we registered the UK branch within 48 hours of making the decision.   We registered the branch for VAT and gave advice on how to raise VAT invoices to customers. The client decided that it would maintain accounting records in the US and we were appointed to prepare and submit the quarterly VAT returns in the UK.   We made an application to register a PAYE scheme and we were appointed to run the payroll including making BACS payments as an authorised BACS bureau.   The client intended to supply its skilled employees in India and the US to the UK branch on secondment for various periods. Our ex-patriate tax team advised the client on the UK tax and social security implications and helped them to decide who to send and for how long.   Our HR Advisory team helped draft secondment agreements, employment contracts for UK employees and HR policies and procedures.   Our independent financial adviser advised the client on establishing a pension scheme and whether employees and secondees would be entitled to join the Autoenrollment scheme.   We helped to arrange employer liability insurance and public liability insurance through a broker that regularly visits our offices to help us provide a one-stop shop to inward investment clients.   In recent years it has become more and more difficult for foreign-owned businesses to open a UK bank account, especially when there are no UK resident directors. We offer a service provided by former bank managers that identifies the bank or banks that are most likely to be interested in opening an account, based on the client’s business, financial forecasts, location and lending requirements. We introduced the client to managers at 2 UK banks and made appointments so that the managing director could fly to the UK and make an application in person. An account was successfully opened within 2 weeks of making the introduction. "," We were asked by a listed Indian company to assist them in establishing their UK subsidiary.  The subsidiary was to be involved in car racing.  Once the company was formed, we were asked to assist them with setting up their accounting records and provide them with monthly management accounts information.  This involved us dealing with the UK Managing Director (“MD”) and the parent company financial controller, originally based in India.  The MD was recruited from the US and we helped in obtaining the appropriate visa by working with the company’s lawyers.  Initially the company had a few transactions and over a period the number of transactions has increased considerably.  The annual value of the transactions is now several million pounds.  As the volume increased and there was need for regular payments, so we set-up appropriate banking systems where we upload the invoices and payments so that approvals could be done remotely.    We assisted the company in obtaining a VAT registration and PAYE registration and the company currently employs 40+ staff.  We assisted in drafting the employment contracts and established staff handbook and other employment policies and procedures.  We have also set-up a cloud based Human Resources system so that management and employees have access to the system to claim expenses, book their holidays etc.  We also assisted with the pension auto-enrollment.  The company was involved in developing new technology which in our view would qualify for Research and Development tax credits.  We discussed this with the client and have been successful in making a number of claims which has benefited the company.  The company continues to invest in Research and Development.  In addition to the above, we work with the client to ensure to ensure all their compliance matters are dealt with.

Goal To set up the staffing establishment of its first overseas subsidiary in the U.K. and operation of its global mobility programme. How we engaged We obtained a sponsorship license for the newly established English subsidiary company before securing a visa for the first U.S. executive to come to England on a sole representative visa.   We advised on all aspects of the client’s global mobility policy from cost of living and expatriate allowances to offering practical help such as organising “look see “ familiarisation visits to the UK for U.S. executives and their families to finding them suitable accommodation as well as schooling for their children to organising the international freight of their goods.  We advised on the tax ad social security aspects of the assignments and organised home and host country tax briefings in the US (with one of our established Correspondent Firms) and England (Abbiss Cadres) and dealt with all compliance issues and filings in both jurisdictions on an ongoing basis.  We dealt with the tax registrations for the new English entity, established and operated its payroll, organised local benefits provision, advised on and implemented pensions auto- enrolment, salary sacrifice arrangements, and the company’s US stock option, restricted stock and all employee stock purchase plan advising on all aspects including tax, social security (including the complex cross border apportionment of chargeable income under such stock plans for tax purposes),  financial services regulation, pensions law, and data protection.  On this occasion we worked with the company’s US counsel on employment law issues as they introduced the client to us to provide the services listed above to supplement their employment law expertise.  Outcome The client’s UK establishment is a success.

In the U.S A. the client had 100+ employees  Goal To establish a UK entity from scratch as the first step to entering the European market. How we engaged The first phase meant taking the client through all the necessary steps to establish their UK base. This involved advising on how best to set up in the UK taking into account planned activities and associated corporate tax issues.  After incorporating Glassdoor’s first international subsidiary we also completed the necessary registrations in relation to their registered office, payroll, tax and company filings. We continue to provide registered office services.  Once established, the client worked with Abbiss Cadres to handle all the employment and immigration issues associated with moving their people over to the UK to staff the office.  This included everything from advising on appropriate expatriate pay and benefit policies to helping Glassdoor move their employees’ belongings over, and find them accommodation and cars.  We obtained a sponsorship license and visas, advised on expatriate tax and social security compliance and all required employment documentation as well as the roll out of the clients US parent company’s stock option programme.   As the subsidiary’s activities expanded, we also continued to provide corporate tax advice to ensure that the U.S. parent company continued to manage its activities through its subsidiary to help it maintain an appropriate corporate tax profile in the U.K.   Outcome Probably best summed up by a quote from the client’s General Counsel:   “By working with Abbiss Cadres, we gained access to a multi-disciplinary team who have proven they’re highly engaged and ready to lend a hand with sensible, practical, cost-effective advice.

We were introduced to this matter through existing relationships at Global Critical Logistics (GCL). Our client, GCL, was looking to acquire Classic Automotive Relocation Services (CARS) and in doing so it would expand their international presence by pushing them further into Europe, the USA, and Asia. Given the international nature of this deal, we worked with our international firms at the World Services Group (WSG) on this, whilst handling the UK element. The client was facing the possibility of having to conduct 3 separate transactions. CARS Group had three different entities set up, and so without our creative collaboration, GCL would’ve needed to instruct three different firms and have them draw up three separate sets of terms. Shoosmiths created a sale and purchase agreement template which was then adapted by our WSG colleagues, to ensure commonality between the agreed terms. Doing this meant that GCL was no longer facing the prospect of handling 3 separate transactions, as Shoosmiths acted as project manager on this matter ensuring conformity and commonality throughout.

Additionally, we reviewed the tax warranties and indemnities in the Sale and Purchase Agreement to ensure that the purchaser obtained sufficient financial protection against the risk areas we identified in our due diligence report.  Our team consisted of specialists in corporation tax, VAT and payroll who worked together to produce a detailed tax due diligence report.  One key risk area identified was in relation to employment taxes and the operation of the Covid-19 Job Retention Scheme. We reviewed the calculation of the claims under the Scheme and highlighted areas of risk, particularly considering the announcement that HMRC would be reviewing such claims due to their suspicion that substantial levels of fraud have taken place.  A further area of risk was the use of self-employed contractors rather than payroll employees. We highlighted the risk of HMRC challenge under IR35 and explained the procedures that the purchaser will need to ensure are implemented once it acquired the target company.

Our client’s goal  Our client, the owner of an existing UK limited SPV company (‘P Ltd’), sought investment in order for P Ltd to purchase and redevelop a large city centre property in the north of England with a view to selling the SPV or the resulting flats.   The owner of P Ltd intended to invest some funds but required the majority of funding to be provided by an outside investor. Elemental was instructed to assist with the introduction of the outside investor and to help structure the investment and joint venture project.  Our client’s main goals were to identify and introduce outside investment and to ensure that P Ltd’s record keeping and governance was of a high standard to ease the burden of due diligence in the event of a sale.  2.	How Elemental engaged with the overseas business  The US resident owner of a Delaware registered investment company (‘W LLC’) indicated interest in the project. Elemental met with W LLC’s owner and the owner of P Ltd in order to discuss what the joint venture might look like from a corporate and investment perspective.   Elemental drafted the shareholders’ agreement and articles of P Ltd and arranged a 70:30 ownership split in favour of W LLC subject to a multi-million pound investment in the property development plan.  Elemental’s guidance and advice in respect of the company law and compliance aspects of the deal put the owner of W LLC at ease and provided the clarity and certainty sought to proceed with the investment.  3.	The outcome  The joint venture documentation was agreed and draw down of the investment into P Ltd commenced. The residential property was successfully developed. Elemental remains involved with the project in a compliance capacity. Two members of our staff were appointed to the board of P Ltd to help ensure that the company was governed well and that the project completed on time and on budget.","1.	Our client’s goal  Our client was a large listed group headquartered in the EU.  Despite a billion-euro market capitalisation, the group did not have a UK presence.  Our client wished to establish a UK subsidiary to both trade in the UK, and to take advantage of the UK’s double tax treaties to expand further across the globe.  2.	How Elemental engaged with the overseas business  Elemental met with the client’s representatives during their trip to London.  Over the next few months advised them on how to structure their UK investment in the UK from a legal and financial perspective.  We made the process of starting a UK business as simple as possible and helped them to incorporate their company and set up the systems and processes necessary to start trading in the UK.  Once the business was up and running, we spoke regularly with our client’s staff in the UK and overseas.  On an ongoing basis, our specialists assisted the company with bookkeeping, accounting, corporation tax, HR, payroll, pensions, Capital Gains Tax, VAT, Intrastat reporting, CbC reporting and ad-hoc legal matters.  We worked closely with the directors and their senior management team to provide a ‘one-stop shop’ for such accounting and compliance services.  We also advised the group on how to use the UK as an intermediary holding jurisdiction, providing detailed tax advice on the UK’s double tax treaty network, the dividend exemption and interest deductibility rules.  The group has, via the UK and with our advice, expanded in to half a dozen international jurisdictions.  3.	The outcome  Our client’s business flourished, and the group invested heavily in their UK subsidiary.  The company employed 30 staff in the UK and turned over £100m+ over a 3 year period.  We worked with them every step of the way and forged a close and productive business relationship.

The Sphering Group is a front-line player in flue and air care in Europe with a renowned expertise in design, manufacturing and distribution of innovative high-quality chimney and ventilation systems.  The Sphering Group wanted to expand its European presence with a location in the UK and targeted a competitor, SFL Ltd, previously part of the Stamm International Corp. who was the No. 2 manufacturer of flues and chimneys in the UK with well-established distribution in the USA and Far East.  Sherrards were introduced to Sphering Group via the London division of the French Chamber of Commerce and were quickly instructed to assist on the targeted acquisition of SFL.  This was Sphering Group’s first targeted UK acquisition of a trading business, and the deal took almost two years to complete due to the cross jurisdictional nature and complexities in the company raised during the research phase and resulting in a complicated escrow fund held by J P Morgan on behalf of the parties and to cover against potential and significant risks of claims associated with the trading business.  The acquisition was eventually successful and adds R&D capabilities and a sixth manufacturing plant to Sphering Group’s industrial capacities already operating in France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, and Poland. With the integration of SFL teams, the Group now employs 800 people across Europe.","Sherrards assisted Chinese company Guangdong Xinbao Electrical Appliance Holdings, which trades under the brand Donlim, with English law aspects for the acquisition of the entire share capital of Morphy Richards Consumer Appliances Limited (MRCA), incorporated in England. Sherrards coordinated directly with Donlim and acted alongside a major law firm in China, as the transaction was subject to extensive negotiations, including requiring approval from the Chinese government. The transaction completed in March 2023. Donlim is headquartered in Shunde, Guangdon, China, and is a major manufacturer of home kitchen appliances and other electrical products, with over 28,000 staff and revenues of RMB 14.9 billion in 2021. Donlim wished to expand its portfolio of international brands by acquiring Morphy Richards, a well regarded British brand established in 1936, and for whom Donlim had been manufacturing products under contract for some time.  MRCA was, before the transaction, owned by Glen Dimplex, an Irish company, and has substantial operations in the UK in addition to other major markets in China, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Glen Dimplex retained the rights to the Morphy Richards brand in other key international markets. The transaction received significant press coverage in the UK and Ireland.  Following completion, Donlim has acquired a permanent presence in the UK and will use this as a platform to expand its consumer appliances offering in the UK market, as well as now having the benefit of an esteemed British brand to use in its operations overseas.","Elizabeth Fehnrich, International Trade Adviser, Department for Business & Trade",Yes,"Legal,Business Support",,,,"Company incorporation,Employment,Immigration","Business relocation,Planning consultants,Staff and family relocation relocation (including schooling for children)",,"Financial and professional services,Legal services","England,Scotland,Wales,Northern Ireland","London,North West,North East,Midlands,South West,South East","Asia-Pacific,North America,Western Europe,North Africa,China and Hong Kong,Caribbean,Central Europe,West Africa,Latin America,Nordic-Baltic Europe,East Africa,Central Asia,Southern Africa,Eastern Europe,Middle East,Mediterranean Europe",,"English,French,Spanish,Mandarin,Cantonese,Italian,German,Hindi,Russian,Turkish,Other, please specify...","Ukrainian, Polish, Afrikaans, Dutch","0 - 10 employees,10 - 50 employees,50 + employees","I confirm that the information provided in this form is complete, true and correct to the best of my knowledge",,Blank,A,0,

The application was granted under the new rules and the company is now taking steps to set up a subsidiary branch in the UK. Following submission of the application, the Home Office indicated they may refuse the application. In 2020, the company had rebranded and split into parts for legitimate tax reasons. The decision maker understood this to mean that they did not meet the requirement of having operating overseas for at least 3 years.  We were given 10 days to respond or withdraw and apply at a later date.  Following further engagement with the client, we decided to challenge this and provided supplementary documents to address why the company structure had changed and that stakeholders remained the same. This was tied together with a detailed letter of representations and rendered a successful outcome.  Without the legal representations of Reiss Edwards, this application would have been refused. We were able to explain why, for legitimate tax reasons, our client had made the correct business decision and that this process did not change 35 years of operations. ","The company is a China based wind power manufacturer and constructs power grids and manufactures diodes.  The goal was to have a UK subsidiary to facilitate additional sales to the global warming conscious UK market, primarily (but not exclusively) targeting businesses with the intention and aspirations of achieving carbon neutrality.  They initially enquired about the Tier 1 Entrepreneur visa route, which had closed. We explained the Representative of an Overseas Business as an alternative to achieving the same access to the UK market.  The senior member of staff intending to manage the UK subsidiary had excellent spoken English, but limited written skills. The Overseas business route had a lower English language requirement then its Tier 1 predecessor. This allowed a timelier application avoiding the need to prepare for a written English test. As the company planned to hire staff immediately on entry, his limed written English would not slow down growth plans.  We reviewed the business plan they had on file and identified key areas to amend including clarity on how it would meet UK manufacturing regulations and safety test measures. We provided a trusted business plan author for our client to work with, which simplified the research process, whilst also allowing us to tie the immigration rules into the plan. The application was granted and the company has since entered the UK bringing to the UK products that will help achieve a better longstanding carbon footprint.

They have attained many recycling licenses around the globe and continue to expand its operations worldwide. In the summer of 2021, they wanted to explore the opportunity of a UK public listing. After consulting us we assembled a professional team which consisted of a UK law firm, reporting accountant firm and UK corporate advisors to conduct a thorough due diligence process. We concluded the UK Aquis market was most suitable and successfully listed the client’s Hong Kong Company in March 2022.  Currently the UK plc has rented a warehouse in Deeside and looking at the next stage of their expansion plans which involves looking at a site to process higher volumes of recycled materials. This will help the UK economy as this project will require manpower.  Our team was able to assist the client with UK Plc company formation, corporate advisory services to enable public listing, opening business bank account, register for VAT and auditing the accounts. We have acted for Majestic Corporation Plc for over 15 months and have board meetings monthly to discuss their management accounts as well as offering business advisory services helping to shape their future expansion plans in the UK.

Through the UKTI network in HK, we were asked to help them set up a UK entity as they wanted to expand their business into the UK. The next step was to recommend professional advisors to enable them to get the appropriate payment institution license.  Effective from 17 January 2023 KeyChain Pay, through KeyChain FinTech (UK) Limited was granted a payment institution license (SPI) by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK. This authorisation is a major milestone enabling KeyChain Pay to provide regulated rental payments services with remittance and payment processing in the UK market.  Our client is excited to receive the license in the UK to scale their rental payment services for their existing customers and partners from HK and potential customers in UK.

This protection was instrumental in Heptares’ business success, facilitating fundraising efforts and fostering valuable partnerships with numerous global pharmaceutical leaders.      Potter Clarkson, demonstrating comprehensive biotech knowledge and international expertise, supported the client throughout its growth and secured a patent portfolio that fortified Heptares’ commercial strategy. The firm's proprietary technologies proved advantageous in securing financing and partnership agreements with world-renowned pharmaceutical and biologics companies. The agreements have yielded over USD 30 million in upfront and milestone payments, and are projected to continue producing revenues in the coming years. The solid patent portfolio also played a significant role in Sosei Group's subsequent USD 400 million acquisition of Heptares in 2015. Heptares' then-CEO lauded it as a stellar instance of converting exceptional UK academic science into economic and potential therapeutic value. Potter Clarkson continues to serve the resulting company, Sosei Heptares, underlining their role as a valuable ally for foreign direct investors.

The company is based in mainland Europe and has several subsidiaries globally, but the brand was unknown in Britain.   Using its extensive knowledge of the client’s sector, The Niblett Whellams Partnership (TNWP) designed and managed a comprehensive multi-channel campaign to raise awareness of the brand and communicate the credentials of the company to potential customers.  The challenge was to help differentiate the company’s offering in an already saturated market,    TNWP worked closely with the international sales manager to develop a marketing communications plan for the British subsidiary.  The local programme of support involved a combination of the following activities: •	Display advertising in professional journals  •	Regular news and feature articles  •	Case studies and clinical articles •	Development of marketing collateral with strong call-to-action and response mechanisms •	Development and management of direct mail campaigns •	Development of branded email platform for customer communications  •	Creation of social media presence and ongoing support with content development and distribution, and follower acquisition •	Creation of opportunities for direct customer engagement, including seminars and networking events •	Provision of sales team advice and support with customer communications, social media training and data protection  Following eighteen months of sustained and consistent campaigning, the British subsidiary was able to demonstrate evidence that awareness of the brand had risen and report steady sales growth against an increasingly aggressive competitive environment.           ","A world leader in the manufacture of dental equipment and devices acquired a close competitor of one of its specialist business units in the UK.

Close liaison was necessary between the senior management teams of the two UK merged companies, and their respective former head offices in Germany and Sweden.  TNWP helped to ensure the messaging was consistent with the newly emerging corporate branding and values.  Culturally, the two merged units were very different so the campaign needed to incorporate a ‘best of both’ theme.   The merger communications programme included the following: •	Intensive public relations campaigning, including development and publication of keynote interview with UK Managing Director •	Display advertising focused on combined attributes of new company •	Sustained programme of news stories and feature articles  •	Development of complementary leaflets and execution of direct mail communications  •	New product announcements •	Promotion of professional education programme   •	Integration of both companies’ customers into business growth support schemes •	Developing and distributing series of advertisements, leaflets and press releases to consumer media in support of company’s direct-to-patient campaigns    •	Developing direct-to-patient marketing materials for use by company’s dentist customers The newly formed company was the only subsidiary to achieve above-target growth in the 24 months following the merger.

The company was looking for an experienced UK professional adviser who could provide advisory services across a broad range of legal and consulting areas, and share their insights from advising other companies who have been on the same journey. The Gateley Global team supported them in the UK by: Project managing their UK entry; Opening a UK business bank account; Registering them for taxes with HMRC; Organising their insurance, and Coordinating further international expansion activities. The wide range of services available across Gateley Group meant that the company only needed to work with one service provider to accomplish all of their UK legal and commercial requirements – making investment into the UK an efficient and straight-forward process to navigate. ","An Australian FinTech company was seeking to expand to the UK. Gateley Global provided market research on three UK regions that matched their specifications (namely, London, Cambridge and Scotland). We compared the industry clusters, availability of grants and equity, operating costs, and labour availability. We then recommended the most suitable region for them, based on their requirements. Gateley Global is now project managing the company’s operational establishment in their selected UK region, including: Company incorporation; Opening a UK bank account; Locating an office space, and Introducing them into the regional FinTech network. By working with Gateley Global, the company has fast-tracked and cemented their investment into the UK. They were able to leverage Gateley Global’s on-the-ground knowledge and capabilities, as well as our skill and understanding of the inwards investment journey.","Julian Davis.
